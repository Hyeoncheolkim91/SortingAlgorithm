# SortingAlgorithm

The purpose of this assignment is to implement various data structures and algorithms described in class. 

Overview
One of the most important ADTs is the Dictionary and one of the most studied problems is sorting. In this assignment, you will write multiple implementations of sorting algorithms.
You must understand when comparisons and movements happen.

# Execute
1. Input a number of size of list you wish to sort.

2. After your input, it will show report of
- insertion sort
- selection sort
- quick sort
- merge sort
- heap sort
- radix sort

3. Each sorting algorithm will sort 4 list properties.

4. Report contains movement, comparison, and total time.

5. It will ask whether you want to test it again or not.

6. Enter 0  to exit or Enter another number of size of list you wish to sort.
